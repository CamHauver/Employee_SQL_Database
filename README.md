This is a data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis project on anonymous company employment from 1980-1990 . The goal is to model the data from various original csv files into a new SQL database.

Original code sources: 
Data Analytics course Module 9 Challenge Starter_Code data csv files
Data Analytics course instructor, Andrew Hoang's, speed run Zoom recording for Module 9 Challenge

Data has been modeled by creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (employee_ERD.jpg) using an online tool; QuickDBD (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) 

Data has been engineered into a SQL database across multiple tables (employees_schema.sql)

Data has been analysed according to the prompts listed below using a series of SQL queries (employees_queries.sql);

1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee

2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986

3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name

4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name

5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B

6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name

7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name

8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
